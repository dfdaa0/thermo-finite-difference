# Problem
There is a plate inside an industrial oven. The plate has an initial temperature of 300°C (573K), and the air temperature inside the oven is 750°C (1023K). For simplicity, we assume that only the sides of the plate are convective. Using the finite difference method, it is possible to calculate the temperature at each discretized point on the plate as time (also discretized) passes.
